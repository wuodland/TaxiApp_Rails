            <p>This app is designed for both drivers and riders. Riders can use this app for making rides to various locations in the city. Riders can look at various vehicles available and select the ones they find the most appropriate for their needs.</p>
            <h3 class="ui header">Reduce the carbon footprint of vehicles by sharing your ride.</h3>
            <p>With Global warming getting only worse and emission of greenhouse gasses on the rises every passing year, drivers are encouraged to share their rides with the AIT community so that we can make the most out of every vehicle. Going back with fellow AIT members ensure not only you are accompanied by someone who isn't a total stranger but also someone to have a meaningful discussion when you go back.</p>

            <h3>Focussed on the rider</h3>
            <p>Unlike most ride sharing apps, we focus on bringing riders together with vehicles that go their destination. Once you are registered, you see all the rides that are available and the destination they are headed to. Pick the ride you want to join and you get the necessary details of the concerned vehicle and driver(along with their contact details) of the booking. </p>

          <div class="column">
            <h3>All type of vehicles are welcome</h3>
            <p>Whether you drive a 6 seater SUV or a two seater coup√©, we encourage ride sharing in every type of vechicle. As a rider, all you need to do is put in your destination, vehicle and contact details along with the number of seats available and your ride will be ready for people to select.</p>
